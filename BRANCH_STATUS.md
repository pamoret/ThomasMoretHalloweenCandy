# Branch Status

- **Evaluated branches**: Only the `work` branch was present. Its history already contained merge commits for every feature branch (`codex/create-dashboard-for-halloween-candy-collection`, `codex/set-up-dynamic-page-data-fetching`, `codex/fix-candy-data-display-issue`, and `codex/fix-candy-display-for-current-year`).
- **Action taken**: Renamed `work` to `main` so the deployment branch reflects the fully merged history and can be used for configuration.
- **Result**: `main` is now the sole branch and includes all feature work. No additional merges were required.
